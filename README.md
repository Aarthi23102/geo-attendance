# Attendance system using Geo-fencing technology

- Our aim for this project is to develop an Application that can help
  both the employees and the employer in making the process of tracking
  attendance, leaves, and live location and recording of on-field
  workerâ€™s attendance faster and more efficiently.
- By making use of an HR Management application, any organisation would
  greatly benefit by reducing error rate, decreased workload designated
  for the management of employees, as well as increase the efficiency of
  time and error rate for an organisation.
